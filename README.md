# Problem Statement 
Cold Chain Logistics company lack the an organised system for __Quality Assurance__ and __Tracking__ which provides __real time data availability__ and __end-to-end data transparency.__ End Consumers have no means of determining the __quality of the product during transportation__ and have to rely on expiry date mentioned on the product.

# Solution
__ColdBlocks__ is a product that enables secure transactions in a cold chain network using __blockchain__. It provides real time data availability and end to end transparency using __IoT__, the goal of the product is to allow the cold chain network to carefully check the status of the product during transportation and to maintain a secure log of transactions. It also allows the end consumers of the product to check if the product was transported in optimal temperature during transportation or not. 

# Specification
ColdBlocks is a decentralized record management system to store electronic transaction records giving priority to the __Quality Assurance (QA), security and real time data availability__. It aims to enhance the working of the current cold chain network.   
ColdBlocks is based on the following technologies - 
* __IoT__
    Using temperature sensors and GPS sensors along with node MCU ESP8266 module to provide WiFi connectivity. The data from these sensors is sent directly to a remote server. 
* __Blockchain__
    Blockchain is used for __Quality Assurance__ of the product being transported in cold storage. Every package is associated with a __threshold temperature__, if the temperature in which the consignment is being transported overshoots the threshold temperature, then the status of the product is updated to __"0"__ which means it's tampered.
* __coldAR__
    __Status Check__ for customers by just scanning a qr-code.
* __Route Optimization__
    Route Optimization based on __VRP__ is implemented using Python and Google or-tools, Gooogle Maps API and Google Directions API.
* __Progressive Web App__ using angularJS and reactJS for admin and other actors of the use case.
* __Android App__ for QR-Code scanning.
ColdBlocks was developed as part of our final year project during B.tech.

# Setup and Installation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To download and setup - 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `git clone https://github.com/mojojojo20/ColdBlocks.git` <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `cd ColdBlocks`

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. composer-rest-server
* `cd coldblocks`
    * Use Hyperledger documentation for installation and setup of Hyperledger Composer and Fabric
    * Start the network and install the BNA.
    * Start the composer REST server using, `composer-rest-server -c admin@coldblocks -n never -u true -w true`

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. node Backend
* `cd coldblocks-nodejs`
    * `npm install` (to install all packages)  
    * `npm run dev`
* Use ngrok to generate a remote server link
* Use the __generated ngrok URL as nodeURL__ in reactJS front-end and as the __HostURL__ in hardware code.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. angular front-end (UI for admin)
* `cd coldblocks-angular`
    * `npm install` (to install all packages)    
    * `npm start`

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. react front-end (UI for Suppliers, Manufacturers, Distributors & Consumers)
* `cd coldblocks-react`
    * `npm install` (to install all packages)  
    * Change __nodeURL__ in variables.jsx with the new server URL.
    * `npm start`
    * Basic Auth Credentials - 
        * __username__ : admin
        * __password__ : admin
    * Credentials for all other users can be set through the admin login. All passwords are SHA256 encrypted.
